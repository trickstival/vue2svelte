Still under development and there's still a long way to go :o

## Install

```bash
npm i vue2svelte
# or
yarn add vue2svelte
```

## Main Goal

Get a Vue options object and convert it into a svelte component

Compiler Roadmap:

- [x] Simple HTML elements rendering
- [x] Default props values
- [x] Simple properties declaration
- [x] v-if statements
- [x] v-else and v-else-if statements
- [x] v-for statements
- [ ] v-once statements
- [ ] v-model support
- [x] v-bind:prop / :prop support
- [ ] v-bind="obj" support
- [ ] Methods
- [ ] Computed properties
- [ ] Mixins
- [ ] Lifecycle hooks
- [ ] Calls to $nextTick
- [ ] Filters
- [ ] Calls to $options

...

Currently it can compile simple pure components with props and data.

This project is a little bit complex, so if you can help please do it!
