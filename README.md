# Vue2Svelte

Still under development and there's still a long way to go :o

## Main Goal

Get a Vue options object and convert it into a svelte component

## Roadmap

- [ ] Declare a Babel Plugin
- [ ] Map props to simple variables in script
- [ ] Map data state to simple variables in script
What else?? (too complex!!)
